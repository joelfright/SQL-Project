# SQL Project

My SQL Project for Sparta Global. 

This entailed using Microsoft Azure alongside the sample [Northwind](https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/sample-data/northwind/) database to create various ```SELECT``` statements.

`/sql` contains all the .sql files for each question

`/excel` contains the excel files for questions 3.2 and 3.4

`SQL Project.pdf` is the full the documentation
